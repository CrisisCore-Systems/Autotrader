## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Windows Compatibility
- PowerShell cp1252 encoding can't handle Unicode symbols
- Always use ASCII for console output on Windows
- UTF-8 works fine for file logging

### 2. Test Suite Design
- API consistency critical (method names must match)
- Enum attributes use `.value` not `.name`
- Always validate test suite before deployment

### 3. Database Lifecycle
- Tables created on first data write (not on schema init)
- Always check for table existence before queries
- Empty database is normal initially - handle gracefully

### 4. Script Organization
- Root level: Main runners (`run_pennyhunter_paper.py`)
- `scripts/`: Utilities, tests, monitors
- Document locations clearly to avoid confusion

### 5. Paper Trading Behavior
- No signals above threshold is NORMAL (good risk management)
- Bot is selective - only trades high-quality setups
- Memory system protects against bad tickers (ADT ejected)

## 🔄 Next Run Expectations

When you run again:

### Scenario A: Signal Found
```
🎯 Found 1 signal above threshold
CLOV scored 6.8/10.0
  Buy: 100 shares @ $2.92
  Entry: $292.00
  Target Tier 1: 5.0% (+$14.60)
  Stop Loss: -8.0% (-$23.36)

Order placed: BUY 100 CLOV @ $2.92
Order filled: CLOV entry @ $2.92
Position monitoring started...
```

### Scenario B: No Signal (Like Today)
```
🎯 Found 0 signals above threshold
No trades placed - waiting for better setups
Account: $200.00 (unchanged)
```

Both scenarios are correct system behavior!
