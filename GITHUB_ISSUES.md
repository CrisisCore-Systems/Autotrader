## üìã Open Issues Summary

### Issue #31: Add Unit Tests and CI Gating for Core Modules
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** bug, enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
Currently, the repository has minimal or no test coverage, which increases the risk of regressions and brittle code evolution. Implement a basic test harness for the core modules, especially feature transforms, reliability patterns, and scoring logic. Integrate these tests into the CI workflow and ensure that PRs are blocked unless tests pass.

**Priority:** HIGH (bug + enhancement)  
**Our Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - We have 21/21 tests passing (13 smoke + 8 integration)

### Issue #30: Enforce JSON Schema Validation for LLM Outputs
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
LLM prompt outputs rely on model compliance but are not validated at runtime, risking malformed responses. Integrate pydantic or jsonschema validation for all AI/LLM outputs before persisting or acting on results. Add tests with golden fixtures for each prompt.

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - No validation layer for LLM outputs yet

---

### Issue #29: Add Structured Logging and Observability
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
The project lacks comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing, making debugging and SLA enforcement difficult. Implement structured (JSON) logging, add Prometheus metrics exporters, and instrument key data ingestion and scoring pipelines for better observability.

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - Basic logging exists but not structured/observability-ready

---

### Issue #28: Implement Data Validation Guardrails in Feature Store
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** bug, enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
There is no validation layer for feature writes (e.g., range checks, null policies). Add invariants to the FeatureStore (such as value ranges and required features), and enforce them at write time to prevent silent poisoning of model inputs.

**Priority:** HIGH (bug + enhancement)  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - No validation guardrails in FeatureStore

---

### Issue #27: Expand Backtest Metrics and Add Baseline Comparisons
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
The backtest harness currently only computes precision@K and average return@K. Extend it to include ROC/AUC, PR curves, information coefficient, time-sliced evaluation, and baseline strategies (random, market-cap weighted, momentum). Store experiment configs and results for reproducibility.

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - Basic backtest harness exists, needs expanded metrics

---

### Issue #26: Harden Security: Secrets, Dependencies, and Docker
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
API keys are managed via environment variables with no rotation or scanning. Add secret scanning to CI (e.g., trufflehog), dependency scanning (pip-audit, Dependabot), and harden Docker images (multi-stage build, non-root user, slim runtime). Add additional Semgrep rules for secret and supply chain risks.

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Environment variables used, GitHub push protection enabled, needs CI scanning

---

### Issue #25: Add Architecture and Feature Catalog Documentation
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** documentation  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
The repository lacks a top-level ARCHITECTURE.md and a canonical feature catalog. Document the core modules, data and feature flows, reliability layer, model lifecycle, and include a feature catalog with descriptions and data contracts for each feature.

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Our Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED - ARCHITECTURE.md exists in repository root

---

### Issue #24: Enhance Reliability Layer: Backoff, Health Endpoints, Alerts
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
Reliability primitives are present but could be enhanced. Add a unified exponential backoff strategy, a health endpoint summarizing system/data source status, alert hooks for open circuit breakers, and per-exchange degradation tracking.

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - Basic reliability exists, needs enhancement

---

### Issue #23: Expand Rule Engine and Alerting System
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
The alert rule engine is basic and only supports a single rule. Expand it to support compound logic, suppression/cool-off, escalation policies, and backtestable alert logic. Add templated alert messages with context (feature diffs, prior period comparison).

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - Basic alert system exists, needs expansion

---

### Issue #22: Implement Data Drift and Freshness Monitoring
**Status:** üü¢ OPEN  
**Labels:** enhancement  
**Created:** October 8, 2025  
**Comments:** 0

**Description:**
There is no monitoring for data drift or feature staleness. Add drift detection (e.g., KL divergence) for feature distributions and enforce data freshness SLAs for critical features. Add dashboard/reporting for operators.

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Our Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK - No drift monitoring implemented
