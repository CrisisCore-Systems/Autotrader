## 🎯 Don't Have Grafana? No Problem!

You can still use everything:

### View Compliance Report (Terminal)

```powershell
python scripts\demo_compliance_monitoring.py
```

**Shows**:
```
✅ Compliance Report Generated:
   Total Issues: 6
   - Critical: 4 (missing risk checks)
   - Warning: 2 (risk score exceeded)

⚠️ Top 5 Issues:
   1. [CRITICAL] missing_risk_check
      Signal executed without recorded risk checks
      Signal: test_sig_20251025_200329_0006

   2. [WARNING] risk_score_exceeded
      Risk score 0.88 exceeds policy limit
      ...
```

### Get Telegram Alerts (Already Working!)

Your Telegram bot is configured and working:
- ✅ Bot Token: 8447164652:AAHTW_...
- ✅ Chat ID: 8171766594
- ✅ 6 alerts successfully sent earlier

Just run `demo_compliance_monitoring.py` and watch your phone! 📱

## 🧪 Generate More Test Data

Want to see more violations?

```powershell
# Create 20 trading cycles with intentional violations
python scripts\run_compliance_test_trading.py --cycles 20 --include-violations

# Then analyze them

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Want to See It Live?

**Option A: Terminal View (Immediate)**
```powershell
python scripts\demo_compliance_monitoring.py
```
Takes 1 minute, shows everything in terminal + sends Telegram alerts.

**Option B: Grafana Dashboard (If Installed)**
1. Import `compliance-monitoring.json`
2. Connect to Prometheus
3. See live visualizations

**Option C: Generate More Data**
```powershell
python scripts\run_compliance_test_trading.py --cycles 50 --include-violations
python scripts\demo_compliance_monitoring.py
```
More violations = more interesting dashboards!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No data in dashboard"

**Cause**: Dashboard needs Prometheus metrics server

**Quick Fix**: Just use terminal view for now
```powershell
python scripts\demo_compliance_monitoring.py
```

You get the same information, just in text format instead of graphs.

### "Want the metrics exporter working"

The exporter needs some dependencies. For now, the compliance demo works perfectly and gives you all the information you need!

The dashboard is ready when you want to set up full Prometheus/Grafana later.
