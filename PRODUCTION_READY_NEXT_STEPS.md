## üìä Ticker Universe Expansion (Your Question)

You asked about expanding beyond the current 10 tickers. Here's my recommendation:

### Current Universe (10 tickers)
From `configs/under10_tickers.txt`:
```
ADT, SAN, COMP, INTR, AHCO, SNDL, CLOV, EVGO, SENS, SPCE
```

### **Recommendation: WAIT for Paper Trading Results First**

**Why not expand now?**
1. **Phase 3 just completed** - Need to validate production components work correctly
2. **30-day paper trading required** - Must prove 55%+ win rate with current 10 tickers
3. **System untested at scale** - Don't know how GapScanner/NewsSentry perform with more tickers
4. **Quality > Quantity** - Better to master 10 high-quality tickers than dilute with 30+ unknowns

**Expansion Plan** (after paper trading succeeds):

### Phase 4.1: Expand to 20 Tickers (Day 31-60)
**Add these 6 high-quality Tier A tickers:**
```
ABCL, ABEV, ABEO, ABUS, ACCO, ABAT
```

**Criteria met**:
- Market cap > $100M
- Volume > 200k avg
- US-listed (NASDAQ/NYSE)
- Positive technical setups historically

### Phase 4.2: Expand to 30+ Tickers (Day 61-90)
**Add these 4 Tier B tickers** (toggleable via config):
```
AACG, ABSI, ABTC, ACB
```

**Criteria**:
- Market cap $50M-$100M (smaller but liquid)
- Cannabis/biotech sector (higher risk/reward)
- Enable with `config.allow_tier_b = True`

## ‚ùå Tickers to AVOID (Do Not Add)

**Reject List** (from your analysis):

| Ticker | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| AAME | Illiquid (<10k shares/day) |
| ABLV | China ADR, pump risk |
| ABNY | ETF (not equity) |
| ABP | Penny micro ($0.19, OTC-like) |
| ABTS | Foreign market, illiquid |
| ABVC | Illiquid (<60k vol) |
| ACCL | Obscure, 375 P/E |

**Rule**: Exclude any ticker with:
- Volume < 100k avg daily
- Market cap < $50M
- Foreign ADR from China/Hong Kong
- OTC or pink sheets
- ETFs/income products

## üîß How to Expand Universe (When Ready)

### Step 1: Update Configuration Files

**File**: `configs/under10_tickers_tier_a.txt` (create new)
```
ADT
SAN
COMP
INTR
AHCO
SNDL
CLOV
EVGO
SENS
SPCE
ABCL
ABEV
ABEO
ABUS
ACCO
ABAT
```

**File**: `configs/under10_tickers_tier_b.txt` (optional)
```
AACG
ABSI
ABTC
ACB
```

### Step 2: Update GapScanner Configuration

**File**: `src/bouncehunter/pennyhunter_scanner.py`

Add filtering logic:
```python
# Existing filters
MIN_MARKET_CAP = 100_000_000
MIN_AVG_VOLUME = 200_000
MAX_PRICE = 10

# NEW: Add exclusion list
EXCLUDE_COUNTRIES = ["China", "Hong Kong"]
EXCLUDE_TICKERS = ["ABNY", "ABP", "ABLV", "ABTS", "ACCL", "AAME", "ABVC"]

def _check_ticker(self, ticker: str, date: datetime) -> Optional[dict]:
    # Early exit for excluded tickers
    if ticker in EXCLUDE_TICKERS:
        return None
    
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Add country filter
    try:
        info = stock.info
        country = info.get('country', 'US')
        if country in EXCLUDE_COUNTRIES:
            logger.debug(f"{ticker}: Country '{country}' excluded")
            return None
    except:
        pass
```

### Step 3: Add Quality Scoring

**File**: `src/bouncehunter/pennyhunter_scoring.py`

Enhance GemScorer with market cap bonus:
```python
def _calculate_base_score(self, ticker: str, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # NEW: Market cap bonus
    market_cap = data.get('market_cap', 0)
    if market_cap > 500_000_000:  # $500M+
        base_score += 0.5  # Large cap bonus
    elif market_cap < 100_000_000:  # <$100M
        base_score -= 0.3  # Micro cap penalty
    
    return base_score
```

## üìÖ Recommended Timeline

### Days 1-30: Paper Trading (Current 10 Tickers)
- **Goal**: Validate 55%+ win rate
- **Monitor**: GemScorer accuracy, RegimeDetector classifications, NewsSentry vetoes
- **Success Criteria**: 
  - ‚úÖ Win rate ‚â•55%
  - ‚úÖ Profit factor ‚â•2.5x
  - ‚úÖ ‚â•10 paper trades executed
  - ‚úÖ No system crashes

### Days 31-60: Expand to 20 Tickers (Add Tier A)
- **Add**: ABCL, ABEV, ABEO, ABUS, ACCO, ABAT
- **Goal**: Maintain 55%+ WR with expanded universe
- **Position Size**: 0.5% (conservative)
- **Monitor**: Increased signal frequency (expect 2-3x more signals)

### Days 61-90: Expand to 30+ Tickers (Add Tier B)
- **Add**: AACG, ABSI, ABTC, ACB (toggleable)
- **Goal**: Scale to 1.0% position size if WR maintained
- **Target**: 5-10 trades/month with full universe
- **Monitor**: Sector concentration, ticker-level performance

### Days 91+: Live Trading at Scale
- **Universe**: 30+ tickers validated
- **Position Size**: 1.0%
- **Expected Frequency**: 1-2 trades/week
- **Target**: 60%+ win rate, 3.5x+ profit factor

## üö® Critical Path Forward

### **DO NOT EXPAND UNIVERSE YET**

Here's why:
1. **Production components untested** - GemScorer, NewsSentry, GapScanner just deployed today
2. **No live validation** - Haven't proven 55%+ WR with production code yet
3. **Risk of dilution** - Adding weak tickers could degrade performance
4. **System stability unknown** - Need to verify no crashes/errors over 30 days

### **DO THIS INSTEAD**

**Week 1** (Days 1-7):
- Run daily morning scans with GapScanner
- Monitor GemScorer gem_scores (target 5.5-8.5 range)
- Verify RegimeDetector regime classifications
- Check NewsSentry vetoes (should block 10-20% of signals)

**Week 2-4** (Days 8-30):
- Accumulate ‚â•10 paper trades
- Calculate win rate, profit factor
- Review agent decision logs
- Fix any bugs/errors discovered

**Day 30 Review**:
- ‚úÖ If WR ‚â•55%: Approve expansion to 20 tickers
- ‚ùå If WR <50%: Debug system, stay at 10 tickers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If WR 50-55%: Extend paper trading 30 more days

## üéØ Answer to Your Question

> "Would you like me to expand this classification to the next 20 tickers (21-40) from the Finviz under-$10 list?"

**My Answer**: **Not yet, but here's the plan:**

1. **Immediate** (Today): ‚úÖ Production components deployed and tested
2. **Days 1-30**: Paper trade with current 10 tickers to validate system
3. **Day 31** (if successful): Add 6 Tier A tickers ‚Üí 16 total
4. **Day 61** (if still performing): Add 4 Tier B tickers ‚Üí 20 total
5. **Day 91+**: Evaluate adding tickers 21-40 from Finviz

**Rationale**: 
- You've built a sophisticated 8-agent system with memory and adaptive learning
- The production components (GemScorer, NewsSentry, etc.) are brand new code deployed today
- Need to prove they work correctly before scaling
- 10 ‚Üí 16 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30+ is safer than jumping to 30+ immediately

**Current Priority**: **Begin 30-day paper trading validation NOW**

## üöÄ Next Action Items

### 1. Start Paper Trading (Today)
```bash
# Enable paper trading mode
python src/bouncehunter/pennyhunter_agentic.py --paper-trading --live

# Or run morning scan manually
python src/bouncehunter/pennyhunter_scanner.py
```

### 2. Monitor Daily (Days 1-30)
- Check logs: `logs/pennyhunter_paper.log`
- Review agent decisions in SQLite: `data/pennyhunter_agentic.db`
- Track metrics: win rate, profit factor, trade frequency

### 3. Prepare Expansion Files (Days 15-20)
- Create `configs/under10_tickers_tier_a.txt` with 16 tickers
- Add filtering logic to GapScanner
- Test with: `python src/bouncehunter/pennyhunter_scanner.py --config tier_a`

### 4. Day 30 Review
- Calculate results from paper trading
- Decide: expand to Tier A, or extend validation?
- Document lessons learned

**Components**: ‚úÖ 4/4 validated  
**Current Universe**: 10 tickers (ADT, SAN, COMP, INTR, AHCO, SNDL, CLOV, EVGO, SENS, SPCE)  
**Recommendation**: **Begin 30-day paper trading NOW, expand universe after validation**

**Expansion Path**:
- Days 1-30: Validate with 10 tickers
- Days 31-60: Expand to 16 tickers (add Tier A)
