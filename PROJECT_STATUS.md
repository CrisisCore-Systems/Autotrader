## 📊 System Architecture

### Primary System: BounceHunter/PennyHunter

**Strategy**: Gap trading on penny stocks using mean reversion

**Components**:
1. **Gap Scanner** (`pennyhunter_scanner.py`) - Identifies gap-down opportunities
2. **Market Regime Detector** (`market_regime.py`) - SPY/VIX monitoring
3. **Signal Scoring** (`signal_scoring.py`) - 0-10 point quality scoring
4. **Advanced Filters** (`advanced_filters.py`) - 5-module risk management
5. **Broker Abstraction** (`broker.py`) - Unified multi-broker interface
6. **Agentic Framework** (`agentic.py`) - 8-agent orchestration system

**Brokers Supported**:
- ✅ Paper (simulated trading)
- ✅ Alpaca (US equities)
- ✅ Questrade (Canadian)
- ✅ Interactive Brokers (IBKR)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Limited Trade History**: Only 2 trades accumulated (need 18 more)
2. **No Statistical Significance**: n=2 insufficient for validation
3. **Single Market Regime**: Both trades in normal regime
4. **No Live Trading**: Paper trading only (by design)

### Technical Debt
1. Legacy crypto scanner code (unused but present)
2. Some documentation references old architecture
3. Test coverage focused on new features (broker, engine, agentic)

### Risks
- **Market Risk**: Gap opportunities may be scarce
- **Time Risk**: May take 2-3 weeks to accumulate 20 trades
- **Validation Risk**: Win rate may fall below 65% target

## 🎯 Near-Term Roadmap (Next 30 Days)

### Week 1-2 (October 21 - November 3)
- [ ] **Daily**: Run paper trading automation
- [ ] **Weekly**: Review win rate trends after 5-10 trades
- [ ] **Goal**: Accumulate 10-15 trades

### Week 3 (November 4-10)
- [ ] **Milestone**: Reach 20 trades
- [ ] **Analysis**: Calculate final Phase 2 metrics
- [ ] **Decision**: Validate 65%+ win rate achieved

### Week 4 (November 11-17)
- [ ] **Phase 2.5**: Implement lightweight memory system
- [ ] **Integration**: Add auto-ejection to daily runner
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate memory integration

## 💡 Key Learnings & Insights

### What's Working Well
1. ✅ **Broker Abstraction**: Clean interface, easy to add new brokers
2. ✅ **Quality Gates**: Signal scoring effectively filters low-quality setups
3. ✅ **Automation**: Daily scripts work reliably
4. ✅ **Canadian Integration**: Questrade auto-refresh tokens working perfectly
5. ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests catch issues early

### Areas for Improvement
1. ⚠️ **Trade Frequency**: May need broader universe for more opportunities
2. ⚠️ **Documentation**: Some guides need operational experience updates
3. ⚠️ **Monitoring**: No real-time alerts yet (manual review only)

### Risk Mitigations Implemented
1. ✅ Market regime filter prevents trading in adverse conditions
2. ✅ Quality gates reduce low-probability setups
3. ✅ Paper trading eliminates capital risk during validation
4. ✅ Comprehensive testing reduces production bugs
