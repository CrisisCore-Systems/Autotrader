- ✅ Optimal filters deployed: Gap 10-15%, Volume 4-10x/15x+
- ✅ Ticker blocklist system active (ADT auto-rejected)
- ✅ Multi-broker integration (Paper, Alpaca, Questrade, IBKR)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (311 files, 50+ test classes)
- 🟢 Out-of-sample validation: 1/20 trades (INTR active)

## 📊 System Architecture

### Primary System: BounceHunter/PennyHunter

**Strategy**: Gap trading on penny stocks using mean reversion

**Components**:
1. **Gap Scanner** (`pennyhunter_scanner.py`) - Identifies gap-down opportunities
2. **Market Regime Detector** (`market_regime.py`) - SPY/VIX monitoring
3. **Signal Scoring** (`signal_scoring.py`) - 0-10 point quality scoring
4. **Advanced Filters** (`advanced_filters.py`) - 5-module risk management
5. **Broker Abstraction** (`broker.py`) - Unified multi-broker interface
6. **Agentic Framework** (`agentic.py`) - 8-agent orchestration system

**Brokers Supported**:
- ✅ Paper (simulated trading)
- ✅ Alpaca (US equities)
- ✅ Questrade (Canadian)
- ✅ Interactive Brokers (IBKR)

## 🚨 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Out-of-Sample Validation**: Only 1 trade active (need 19 more completed)
2. **No Statistical Significance**: n=1 insufficient for validation (need 5+ completed)
3. **Single Market Regime**: All trades in RISK_ON regime
4. **No Live Trading**: Paper trading only (by design during validation)

### Technical Debt
1. Legacy crypto scanner code (unused but present)
2. Some documentation references old architecture
3. Test coverage focused on new features (broker, engine, agentic)

### Risks
- **Market Risk**: Gap opportunities may be scarce
- **Time Risk**: May take 2-3 weeks to accumulate 20 trades
- **Validation Risk**: Win rate may fall below 65% target

## 🎯 Near-Term Roadmap (Next 30 Days)

### Week 1-2 (October 21 - November 3)
- [ ] **Daily**: Run paper trading automation
- [ ] **Weekly**: Review win rate trends after 5-10 trades
- [ ] **Goal**: Accumulate 10-15 trades

### Week 3 (November 4-10)
- [ ] **Milestone**: Reach 20 trades
- [ ] **Analysis**: Calculate final Phase 2 metrics
- [ ] **Decision**: Validate 65%+ win rate achieved

### Week 4 (November 11-17)
- [ ] **Phase 2.5**: Implement lightweight memory system
- [ ] **Integration**: Add auto-ejection to daily runner
- [ ] **Testing**: Validate memory integration

## 💡 Key Learnings & Insights

### What's Working Well
1. ✅ **Optimal Filters Deployed**: Gap 10-15%, Volume 4-10x/15x+ achieve 70% WR
2. ✅ **Critical Discovery**: Found scoring inversion through systematic analysis
3. ✅ **Ticker Blocklist**: ADT auto-rejected (21.4% WR → eliminated)
4. ✅ **Signal Quality**: First out-of-sample trade (INTR) matches optimal ranges perfectly
5. ✅ **Broker Abstraction**: Clean interface, easy to add new brokers
6. ✅ **Automation**: Daily scripts work reliably with new filters
7. ✅ **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests catch issues early

### Areas for Improvement
1. ⚠️ **Trade Frequency**: May need broader universe for more opportunities
2. ⚠️ **Documentation**: Some guides need operational experience updates
3. ⚠️ **Monitoring**: No real-time alerts yet (manual review only)

### Risk Mitigations Implemented
1. ✅ Market regime filter prevents trading in adverse conditions
2. ✅ Quality gates reduce low-probability setups
3. ✅ Paper trading eliminates capital risk during validation
4. ✅ Comprehensive testing reduces production bugs

**Status Summary**: 🟢 **PHASE 2 OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE - VALIDATING**

Phase 2 optimization successfully completed with 70% win rate on 30 backtested trades. Optimal filters (Gap 10-15%, Volume 4-10x/15x+) deployed to production. Out-of-sample validation in progress with 1/20 trades active (INTR - perfect filter match). On pace to complete validation within 2-4 weeks.

**Next Action**: Continue daily paper trading to accumulate 20 trades for out-of-sample validation.
