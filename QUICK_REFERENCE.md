# ⚡ Quick Reference: Gap Trading Without Real-Time Data

## 🎯 The Core Concept

**Your system trades GAPS, not MOMENTUM**

- ❌ NOT a scalper (0.1% profit targets, needs real-time)
- ❌ NOT a day trader (50+ trades/day, needs streaming)
- ✅ YES a gap trader (8-15% targets, 1-3 trades/day)
- ✅ YES EOD workflow (scan evening → trade morning)

---

## ⏰ Daily Time Commitment

| Phase | Time/Day | When |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Phase 2** (Manual) | 30 min | 15 min evening + 15 min morning |
| **Phase 2.5** (Semi-auto) | 10 min | Monitoring only |
| **Phase 3** (Full auto) | 2 min | Review email summary |

---

## 📊 Data Needs

### What You Need
- ✅ **EOD prices** - Yahoo Finance (FREE)
- ✅ **5-min candles** - Yahoo Finance (FREE, 15-min delay OK)
- ✅ **Broker API** - For order execution (FREE with account)

### What You DON'T Need
- ❌ Real-time streaming ($50-100/month)
- ❌ Level 2 order book
- ❌ Millisecond execution
- ❌ All-day monitoring

## 🔄 The Workflow (30 Seconds)

```
Evening (10 min):
  python run_pennyhunter_nightly.py
  → Scan 200 stocks → Find 2-3 setups → Generate watchlist

Morning (20 min):
  9:30-10:30 AM → Monitor 2-3 tickers → Enter on VWAP reclaim
  → Exit at +8% target OR 10:30 AM time stop

Review (5 min):
  python scripts\analyze_pennyhunter_results.py
  → Check win rate → Commit results to Git
```

**Total**: 35 min/day

## 💡 Why 15-Min Delay Doesn't Matter

**Your profit target**: 8-15% ($0.68 on $8.50 stock)  
**15-min delay slippage**: ~$0.02 (0.2%)  
**Slippage as % of profit**: 3%  

**97% of profit retained** ✅

## 🤔 Common Scenarios

### "I have a day job"
→ Use **GTC limit orders** + mobile alerts  
→ Total phone time: 10 min (bathroom + coffee breaks)

### "I want full automation"
→ Wait for **Phase 3** (after 50 trades validated)  
→ Bot trades autonomously 9:30-10:30 AM

### "What if I miss the entry?"
→ **Skip the trade** (don't chase)  
→ Strategy has 1-3 setups/day (wait for next one)

### "How do I know if gap is still valid?"
→ Check **pre-market** at 9:25 AM  
→ If gap faded or offering news → skip trade

## 🎯 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Win Rate** | 65-75% | Phase 2 validation goal |
| **Profit Factor** | ≥1.5 | Risk-adjusted profitability |
| **Trades/Day** | 1-3 | Low frequency = manageable |
| **Hold Time** | 30 min - 3 hrs | Not a scalper (slow entries OK) |
| **Max Drawdown** | <15% | Risk management working |

**Current**: 2/20 trades, 100% win rate (preliminary)
