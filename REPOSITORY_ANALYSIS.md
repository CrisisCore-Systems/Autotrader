## Tree of Thought Analysis

### Branch 1: What IS This Repository?

#### 1.1 Primary Identity
The repository is a **multi-strategy algorithmic trading system** with two distinct but integrated approaches:

**System A: Hidden-Gem Scanner (Crypto)**
- On-chain telemetry analysis for early token discovery
- Narrative intelligence and sentiment analysis
- Technical analysis with safety gating
- GemScore ensemble scoring (0-100 scale)
- Human-in-the-loop decision support

**System B: BounceHunter/PennyHunter (Equities)**
- Gap-down mean-reversion strategy for equities
- Machine learning probability estimation
- 8-agent orchestration system with memory
- Multi-broker execution (Paper, Alpaca, Questrade, IBKR)
- Automated paper trading workflow

#### 1.2 Core Value Proposition
The system aims to **reduce noise-to-signal ratio** in financial markets by:
1. Aggregating multi-source data (on-chain, market, sentiment, derivatives)
2. Applying ML-driven feature engineering and risk filters
3. Providing ranked, actionable signals with explainability
4. Maintaining human oversight through dashboards and alerts
5. Creating archivable "Collapse Artifacts" for research continuity

#### 1.3 Design Philosophy
The codebase reveals strong adherence to:
- **Reliability First**: Circuit breakers, caching, SLA monitoring for all external dependencies
- **Safety Gating**: Multi-layer risk filters before any trade signal
- **Observability**: Structured logging, Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing
- **Feature Store Pattern**: Centralized feature management with versioning
- **Agentic Architecture**: Specialized agents with persistent memory for adaptive learning

5. Advanced Filters → Liquidity delta, slippage, sector limits
6. Order Placement → Bracket orders via broker API
7. Memory Persistence → Store signals, actions, outcomes for learning
```

**Monitoring & Alerting**
- Prometheus metrics server on port 9090
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry
- Multi-channel alerting (Telegram, Slack, email)
