## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Database migration fails or causes downtime
- **Mitigation**: Staged migration with rollback plan, extensive testing
- **Contingency**: Keep SQLite as backup for 3 months

**Risk**: External API rate limits exceeded
- **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breakers, add fallback sources
- **Contingency**: Upgrade to paid API tiers if needed

**Risk**: Model drift reduces strategy performance
- **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring, automated retraining
- **Contingency**: Fallback to baseline strategy weights

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Regulatory changes restrict trading
- **Mitigation**: SOC2 certification, legal counsel
- **Contingency**: Pivot to research-only platform

**Risk**: Competition from larger platforms
- **Mitigation**: Focus on niche markets (gap trading, crypto)
- **Contingency**: Open-source community edition moat

**Risk**: Limited engineering resources
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize ruthlessly, outsource non-core
- **Contingency**: Slow down roadmap, extend timelines

### Q4 2025 Gate: Continue or Pivot?
**Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ Phase 2 validation achieves ≥65% win rate → Continue to Q1 2026
- ❌ Phase 2 validation shows <50% win rate → Pivot strategy or pause

### Q1 2026 Gate: Scale or Maintain?
**Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ HA architecture stable, PostgreSQL performing well → Scale to Q2 2026
- ❌ Instability or performance issues → Focus on stabilization

### Q2 2026 Gate: Expand or Focus?
**Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ RL and multi-asset show positive results → Expand to Q3 2026
- ❌ Features underperform → Focus on core strategy optimization

### Q3 2026 Gate: Enterprise or Community?
**Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ 5+ enterprise prospects identified → Prioritize enterprise features
- ❌ Low enterprise interest → Double down on community/marketplace
