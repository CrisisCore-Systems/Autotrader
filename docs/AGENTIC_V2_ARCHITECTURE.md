## Architecture Overview

### V1 vs V2 Comparison

```
V1 (Sequential Ring):
Sentinel → Screener → Forecaster → RiskOfficer → NewsSentry → Trader
(Sequential, 800ms latency, single hypothesis)

V2 (Parallel Tree-of-Thought):
                    ┌─ Sentinel ─┐
                    ├─ Screener ─┤
    Signal Entry ──>├─ Forecaster├──> Tree-of-Thought ──> Metacognition ──> Action
                    ├─ RiskOfficer┤      Reasoner
                    └─ NewsSentry ┘
    (Async parallel, 200ms latency, multiple hypotheses)
```

---

## Core Enhancements

### 1. Tree-of-Thought Reasoning (`reasoning.py`)

**Problem**: V1 uses single-path reasoning (one prediction → one decision)

**Solution**: Multiple reasoning branches evaluated in parallel:

```python
class TreeOfThoughtReasoner:
    def reason(self, signal, context) -> ThoughtTree:
        branches = [
            self._technical_analysis_branch(),    # Technical indicators
            self._historical_pattern_branch(),    # Pattern matching
            self._risk_adjusted_branch(),         # R:R evaluation
            self._regime_aware_branch(),          # Market context
        ]
        return ThoughtTree(branches, consensus, agreement)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Catches edge cases missed by single model
- ✅ Provides reasoning transparency
- ✅ Higher confidence when branches agree
- ✅ Red flag when branches disagree

**Example Output**:
```
Root: "Should we enter AAPL at $150?"
├─ Technical: ✓ Support (RSI 8.2, BCS 0.72) → Confidence 0.75
├─ Historical: ✓ 12/15 similar setups won (80%) → Confidence 0.78
├─ Risk: ✓ 1.5:1 R:R, +1.2% EV → Confidence 0.68
└─ Regime: ⚠ High VIX (85th percentile) → Confidence 0.45

Consensus: 0.67 | Agreement: 0.82 (high) | Decision: APPROVE
```

---

### 2. Metacognitive Reflection

**Problem**: Agents don't question their own confidence

**Solution**: Self-awareness layer that asks "How confident should I be in my confidence?"

```python
class MetacognitiveReflector:
    def reflect(self, thought_tree, agent_outputs, signal, context):
        reflections = [
            self._check_calibration(),        # Am I overconfident?
            self._check_distribution(),       # Is this out-of-sample?
            self._check_agent_agreement(),    # Do agents disagree?
            self._check_data_quality(),       # Is data reliable?
        ]
        return confidence_adjustments
```

**Example Adjustments**:
```python
Initial Confidence: 0.72

Reflections:
- Overconfidence detected: -0.15 (historical 12% overconfidence)
- Out-of-distribution: -0.10 (VIX 90th percentile)
- High agent disagreement: -0.08 (σ=0.28 across agents)

Adjusted Confidence: 0.39 → VETO (too uncertain)
```

---

### 3. Ensemble Forecasting (`ensemble.py`)

**Problem**: Single logistic regression model is brittle

**Solution**: Multi-model ensemble with uncertainty quantification

**Models**:
1. **Logistic Regression** - Linear baseline (fast, interpretable)
2. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting (captures non-linear patterns)
3. **Random Forest** - Ensemble trees (robust, variance estimates)
4. **Neural Network** - Deep patterns (complex interactions)

**Key Features**:
```python
ensemble_pred = EnsembleForecaster.predict_with_uncertainty(features)

# Returns:
{
    "probability": 0.67,         # Weighted ensemble prediction
    "confidence": 0.62,          # Adjusted for uncertainty
    "uncertainty": 0.18,         # Prediction uncertainty
    "agreement": 0.85,           # Model agreement (high)
    "model_predictions": {
        "logistic": 0.65,
        "xgboost": 0.72,
        "random_forest": 0.68,
        "neural_net": 0.63
    }
}
```

**Dynamic Weighting**:
- Models are weighted by recent performance
- Poor-performing models get downweighted
- Adapts to regime changes automatically

---

### 4. Causal Attribution (Planned - `attribution.py`)

**Problem**: Know "trade won +3%" but not WHY

**Solution**: Decompose outcomes into controllable factors

```python
class CausalAttributor:
    def attribute_outcome(self, trade, pnl):
        return {
            "alpha": +0.02,               # Actual skill
            "beta_contribution": +0.01,   # Market tailwind (SPY +1%)
            "signal_quality": +0.015,     # Good BCS (0.72)
            "timing": -0.005,             # Entry execution (mediocre)
            "news_catalyst": 0.00,        # No major news
            "regime_impact": -0.01,       # VIX rose during trade
            "residual": +0.005            # Unexplained (luck/noise)
        }
```

**Benefits**:
- Credit/blame agents for controllable factors
- Ignore luck/noise in learning
- Identify what actually drives performance
- Targeted improvements (e.g., improve entry timing)

---

### 5. Dynamic Agent Weighting (Planned - `adaptation.py`)

**Problem**: Static veto weights (0.15-0.20) for all agents

**Solution**: Performance-based adaptive weighting

```python
class DynamicWeightManager:
    def calculate_weight(self, agent_name, regime):
        precision = correct_vetos / total_vetos
        recall = correct_approvals / total_approvals
        f1_score = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
        
        # Regime-specific adjustment
        regime_multiplier = agent_performance_in_regime / baseline
        
        return base_weight * f1_score * regime_multiplier
```

**Example Evolution**:
```
Week 1: All agents have 0.20 weight (equal)

Week 4: Agent performance diverges
- RiskOfficer: 0.32 (85% precision, great vetos)
- NewsSentry: 0.08 (45% precision, too many false alarms)
- Forecaster: 0.25 (steady performance)
- Sentiment: 0.15 (moderate performance)

System automatically trusts RiskOfficer more, downweights NewsSentry
```

---

### 6. Continuous Learning (Planned - `adaptation.py`)

**Problem**: Models trained once, never adapted

**Solution**: Automatic retraining on distribution drift

```python
class ContinuousLearner:
    async def monitor_and_adapt(self):
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(6 * 3600)  # Check every 6 hours
            
            # Detect feature drift
            drift_score = calculate_drift(recent_signals, historical_dist)
            if drift_score > 0.15:
                await self.retrain_models()
            
            # Detect performance drift
            if current_hit_rate < historical_hit_rate - 0.10:
                await self.retrain_models()
            
            # Update agent weights daily
            await self.weight_manager.update_weights()
```

**Drift Detection**:
- Feature distribution changes (VIX regime shift)
- Performance degradation (hit rate drops)
- Automatic model refresh without human intervention

---

### 7. Hierarchical Memory (Planned - `memory_v2.py`)

**Problem**: Flat SQLite schema lacks relationships

**Solution**: 4-level knowledge pyramid

```
Level 1: Raw Events (immutable)
├─ market_data (OHLCV, VIX, SPY)
├─ signals (BCS, features, timestamps)
├─ agent_actions (vetos, approvals, reasoning chains)
└─ order_events (fills, cancels, position updates)

Level 2: Derived Knowledge (computed)
├─ trade_outcomes (PnL, duration, exit reason)
├─ causal_attributions (alpha, beta, signal quality, etc.)
├─ agent_performance (precision, recall, F1 by regime)
└─ pattern_library (successful setups clustered)

Level 3: Abstract Concepts (learned)
├─ regime_profiles (VIX/SPY clusters with success rates)
├─ ticker_personalities (AAPL bounces 65%, AMD 52%, etc.)
├─ strategy_templates (tight-stop, scale-in, confirm-first)
└─ risk_boundaries (dynamic position limits by regime)

Level 4: Meta-Knowledge (reasoning about reasoning)
├─ agent_relationships (which agents complement each other?)
├─ failure_modes (common mistake patterns)
├─ confidence_calibration (are we overconfident? by how much?)
└─ opportunity_cost (what profitable signals did we miss?)
```

**New Tables**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_reasoning (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    agent_name TEXT,
    signal_id TEXT,
    reasoning_type TEXT,  -- 'tree_branch', 'counterfactual', 'meta'
    reasoning_path TEXT,  -- JSON: chain of thought
    conclusion TEXT,
    confidence REAL,
    timestamp DATETIME
);

CREATE TABLE causal_attributions (
    trade_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    alpha REAL,
    beta_contribution REAL,
    signal_quality REAL,
    timing_quality REAL,
    news_impact REAL,
    regime_impact REAL,
    residual REAL
);

CREATE TABLE regime_profiles (
    regime_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    vix_range TEXT,
    spy_trend TEXT,
    avg_hit_rate REAL,
    optimal_size_pct REAL,
    best_agent TEXT
);
```

---

### 8. Async Parallel Execution (Planned - `agentic_enhanced.py`)

**Problem**: Sequential ring topology is slow (800ms)

**Solution**: All agents evaluate in parallel

```python
class EnhancedOrchestrator:
    async def evaluate_signal(self, signal):
        # Phase 1: Parallel agent evaluation (200ms)
        agent_results = await asyncio.gather(
            self.sentinel.evaluate_async(signal),
            self.forecaster.evaluate_async(signal),
            self.risk_officer.evaluate_async(signal),
            self.news_sentry.evaluate_async(signal),
        )
        
        # Phase 2: Tree-of-thought reasoning
        thought_tree = await self.tot_reasoner.reason_async(signal)
        
        # Phase 3: Metacognitive reflection
        reflections = await self.meta_reflector.reflect_async(
            thought_tree, agent_results, signal
        )
        
        # Phase 4: Weighted voting with dynamic weights
        score = self.aggregate_with_weights(agent_results, reflections)
        
        return decision
```

**Performance**:
- Sequential: 4 agents × 200ms = 800ms
- Parallel: max(200ms) = 200ms
- **4x throughput improvement**

---

### 9. Hypothesis Exploration (Planned)

**Problem**: Single entry strategy per signal

**Solution**: Explore multiple execution strategies

```python
class HypothesisExplorer:
    def explore_strategies(self, signal):
        hypotheses = [
            {"name": "standard", "stop": 2%, "target": 3%, "size": 1.2%},
            {"name": "tight_stop", "stop": 1.5%, "target": 2.5%, "size": 1.5%},
            {"name": "scale_in", "stop": 2%, "target": 4%, "size": 0.6%+0.6%},
            {"name": "confirm_first", "stop": 2%, "target": 3.5%, "delay": 0.5%}
        ]
        
        # Score each by expected value
        best = max(hypotheses, key=lambda h: h.expected_value)
        return best
```

**Example**:
```
AAPL Signal at $150:

Hypothesis Evaluation:
1. Standard: EV +1.2%, Risk 2%, Score: 78
2. Tight Stop: EV +0.9%, Risk 1.5%, Score: 72
3. Scale-In: EV +1.5%, Risk 2%, Score: 85 ← BEST
4. Confirm First: EV +1.1%, Risk 2%, Score: 75

Selected: Scale-In strategy (highest EV, confirmation reduces risk)
Entry: $150, Add at $151.50 (+1%), Stop $147, Target $156
```

---

### 10. Counterfactual Learning (Implemented in `reasoning.py`)

**Problem**: Vetoed signals are forgotten (no learning from missed opportunities)

**Solution**: Track "what-if" outcomes

```python
class CounterfactualTracker:
    def log_veto(self, signal, agent, reason):
        # Store hypothetical trade
        memory.insert_counterfactual({
            "ticker": signal.ticker,
            "entry": signal.entry,
            "stop": signal.stop,
            "target": signal.target,
            "vetoed_by": agent,
            "veto_reason": reason,
            "veto_date": now(),
        })
    
    def resolve_counterfactuals(self):
        # 5 days later, check what actually happened
        for cf in unresolved_counterfactuals:
            actual_outcome = check_price_movement(cf)
            
            if actual_outcome == "WOULD_WIN":
                # Agent made a mistake (vetoed a winner)
                memory.log_agent_mistake(cf.vetoed_by, "false_negative")
            elif actual_outcome == "WOULD_LOSE":
                # Agent was correct to veto
                memory.credit_agent(cf.vetoed_by, "correct_veto")
```

**Learning Loop**:
```
Day 1: RiskOfficer vetos AAPL (reason: "Too close to earnings")
Day 6: AAPL bounced +4.2% (would have won)
Result: RiskOfficer -1 point for false negative
Action: Reduce RiskOfficer weight for earnings-related vetos
```

orch = Orchestrator(policy, db)

# New way (opt-in enhancements)
from bouncehunter.agentic_enhanced import EnhancedOrchestrator
orch = EnhancedOrchestrator(
    policy, 
    db,
    features=[
        "async",           # 4x faster parallel execution
        "ensemble",        # Multi-model forecaster
        "tree_of_thought", # Multiple reasoning branches
        "metacognition",   # Self-awareness checks
        "attribution",     # Causal learning
    ]
)
```

### Progressive Adoption

**Week 1**: Enable ensemble forecaster only
```bash
python -m bouncehunter.agentic_cli --enhanced --features ensemble
```
- Validate: +8% hit rate improvement
- Risk: Low (fallback to logistic if ensemble fails)

**Week 2**: Add tree-of-thought reasoning
```bash
python -m bouncehunter.agentic_cli --enhanced --features ensemble,tree_of_thought
```
- Validate: Better confidence calibration
- Risk: Low (adds reasoning layer, doesn't break existing)

**Week 3**: Add metacognition
```bash
python -m bouncehunter.agentic_cli --enhanced --features ensemble,tree_of_thought,metacognition
```
- Validate: Fewer overconfident trades
- Risk: Medium (adjusts confidence scores)

**Week 4**: Enable all features
```bash
python -m bouncehunter.agentic_cli --enhanced --features all
```
- Validate: Full V2 system operational
- Risk: Medium (requires new memory schema)
