# Agent Weighting System - Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Production Ready  
**Version**: 1.0

## üéØ **Overview**

The Agent Weighting System is a machine learning enhancement that tracks individual agent performance and weights their votes based on historical accuracy. This allows the system to learn which agents are most reliable and give them more influence in decision-making.

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

### **1. Agent Performance Tracking**

Every trade outcome is used to update agent accuracy:

```python
class AgenticMemory:
    def update_agent_performance(self, signal_id: str, outcome_won: bool):
        """
        Tracks whether each agent's vote was correct:
        - Approval + Win = correct_approval  
        - Veto + Loss = correct_veto
        - Approval + Loss = incorrect
        - Veto + Win = incorrect
        """
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_performance (
    agent_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    total_votes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_approvals INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_vetoes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    correct_approvals INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    correct_vetoes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    accuracy REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    last_updated TEXT
);
```

### **2. Agent Weight Calculation**

Weights are calculated based on historical accuracy:

| Accuracy | Weight | Interpretation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **‚â• 90%** | 1.5x | Highly accurate agent |
| **70-90%** | 1.0x | Baseline performance |
| **50-70%** | 0.75x | Below average |
| **< 50%** | 0.5x | Poor performance |

**Minimum 5 votes required** for reliable weight calculation.

```python
def get_agent_weights(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Returns weights between 0.5 and 1.5 based on accuracy."""
    if total_votes < 5:
        return 1.0  # Default weight until proven
    
    if accuracy >= 0.90:
        return 1.5
    elif accuracy >= 0.70:
        return 1.0
    elif accuracy >= 0.50:
        return 0.75
    else:
        return 0.5
```

### **3. Weighted Consensus Calculation**

Instead of binary veto (ANY agent can block), we use weighted voting:

```python
consensus_score = (
    sum(agent_weight * (1 if approved else 0) for each agent) /
    sum(all agent weights)
)
```

**Example:**
- Forecaster (90% accuracy, 1.5x weight): ‚úÖ APPROVE
- RiskOfficer (85% accuracy, 1.0x weight): ‚ùå VETO  
- NewsSentry (70% accuracy, 1.0x weight): ‚úÖ APPROVE

**Consensus = (1.5 + 0.0 + 1.0) / (1.5 + 1.0 + 1.0) = 2.5 / 3.5 = 71.4%**

If threshold is 70%, trade is **APPROVED** (weighted consensus overrides single veto).

---

## üîÑ **Adaptive Threshold Strategy**

The system uses **adaptive consensus thresholds** based on trade count:

### **Phase 1: Binary Veto Mode (Trades 1-19)**
- **Threshold**: 100% (unanimous approval required)
- **Reason**: Not enough data to weight agents reliably
- **Behavior**: ANY agent veto blocks trade (conservative)

### **Phase 2: Weighted Consensus Mode (Trades 20+)**
- **Threshold**: 70% (configurable)
- **Reason**: Enough data to differentiate agent accuracy
- **Behavior**: Weighted votes, accurate agents have more influence

**Code Implementation:**
```python
class WeightedConsensus:
    def should_trade(self, agent_votes: Dict[str, bool]) -> Tuple[bool, float, str]:
        total_trades = self.memory.get_overall_performance()["total_trades"]
        
        # Binary mode until 20 trades
        if total_trades < 20:
            all_approved = all(agent_votes.values())
            return all_approved, 1.0 if all_approved else 0.0, "Binary mode"
        
        # Weighted mode after 20 trades
        consensus = self.calculate_consensus_score(agent_votes)
        return consensus >= 0.70, consensus, "Weighted mode"
```

## üìä **Agent Performance Dashboard**

### **After 8 Trades (6W/2L, 75% WR):**

| Agent | Total Votes | Approvals | Vetoes | Accuracy | Weight |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| **Forecaster** | 8 | 8 | 0 | 75.0% | 1.0x |
| **RiskOfficer** | 8 | 8 | 0 | 75.0% | 1.0x |
| **NewsSentry** | 8 | 8 | 0 | 75.0% | 1.0x |
| **Sentinel** | 8 | 8 | 0 | 75.0% | 1.0x |
| **Screener** | 8 | 8 | 0 | 75.0% | 1.0x |
| **Trader** | 8 | 8 | 0 | 75.0% | 1.0x |

**Note:** All agents currently have equal weight because they all approved the same 8 trades. Weights will diverge as agents start disagreeing on signals.

---

## üî¨ **Backtest Validation Results**

### **Test Configuration:**
- **Date Range**: 2019-01-01 to 2025-10-18 (6 years)
- **Signals**: 32 Phase 2.5 signals
- **Consensus Mode**: Binary (trades 1-19), Weighted (trades 20+)

### **Results:**

| Mode | Trades | Win Rate | Profit Factor | Avg Return |
|------|--------|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Binary Veto** | 8 | 75.0% | 6.00x | +6.25% |
| **Weighted (70%)** | 24 | 54.2% | 2.33x | +3.05% |
| **Adaptive** | 8 ‚Üí TBD | 75.0% ‚Üí TBD | 6.00x ‚Üí TBD | +6.25% ‚Üí TBD |

**Interpretation:**
- **Binary mode** is highly selective (8/32 signals = 25% pass rate) with excellent quality
- **Pure weighted mode** is too lenient without historical differentiation
- **Adaptive mode** starts strict and loosens only when agents prove accuracy

---

## üéõÔ∏è **Configuration Parameters**

### **WeightedConsensus Settings:**

```python
WeightedConsensus(
    memory=AgenticMemory(),
    min_consensus=0.70,  # 70% weighted approval needed (Phase 2)
    min_trades_for_weighting=20  # Binary mode until 20 trades
)
```

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `min_consensus` | 0.70 | 0.50-0.95 | Weighted approval threshold |
| `min_trades_for_weighting` | 20 | 10-50 | Trades before enabling weighting |

### **Agent Weight Ranges:**

```python
# In AgenticMemory.get_agent_weights()
WEIGHT_EXCELLENT = 1.5  # ‚â•90% accuracy
WEIGHT_GOOD = 1.0       # 70-90% accuracy
WEIGHT_FAIR = 0.75      # 50-70% accuracy
WEIGHT_POOR = 0.5       # <50% accuracy
MIN_VOTES = 5           # Minimum votes for weight adjustment
```

---

## üöÄ **Deployment Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Binary Mode (Days 1-30)**
1. Start 30-day paper trading
2. Collect 20+ trades in binary veto mode
3. Track agent accuracy in database
4. Monitor for agent disagreements

### **Phase 2: Weighted Transition (Days 31-60)**
1. System automatically switches to weighted mode after 20 trades
2. Monitor consensus scores (should be 70-95%)
3. Adjust `min_consensus` if needed:
   - If win rate drops below 60%: Raise to 0.75 or 0.80
   - If win rate stays above 75%: Lower to 0.65

### **Phase 3: Adaptive Optimization (Days 61+)**
1. Agents diverge in accuracy (some >80%, others <60%)
2. Weights differentiate (1.5x for best, 0.5x for worst)
3. System learns optimal agent influence
4. Expected: +5-10% win rate improvement over binary

---

## üîß **Maintenance & Monitoring**

### **Daily Checks:**
1. **Agent Accuracy**: Review `agent_performance` table
2. **Consensus Scores**: Monitor average consensus (should be 70-90%)
3. **Veto Patterns**: Identify agents that veto frequently

### **Weekly Adjustments:**
1. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust `min_consensus` based on win rate
2. **Weight Review**: Check for outlier agents (<40% or >90% accuracy)
3. **Database Cleanup**: Archive old agent performance data (>6 months)

### **SQL Queries for Monitoring:**

```sql
-- Agent performance summary
SELECT 
    agent_name,
    total_votes,
    accuracy,
    CASE 
        WHEN accuracy >= 0.90 THEN 1.5
        WHEN accuracy >= 0.70 THEN 1.0
        WHEN accuracy >= 0.50 THEN 0.75
        ELSE 0.5
    END as weight
FROM agent_performance
ORDER BY accuracy DESC;

-- Recent consensus scores
SELECT 
    date,
    ticker,
    consensus_score,
    final_decision
FROM daily_logs
ORDER BY date DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Agent disagreement analysis
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as disagreements,
    SUM(CASE WHEN forecaster_vote = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as forecaster_vetoes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN riskofficer_vote = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as riskofficer_vetoes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN newssentry_vote = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as newssentry_vetoes
FROM agentic_signals
WHERE vetoed = 1;
```

## üéì **Future Enhancements**

### **Phase 4: Regime-Specific Weights (Q1 2026)**
Track agent accuracy separately by regime:
- Forecaster: 90% in normal, 70% in high-vix ‚Üí Different weights per regime

### **Phase 5: Sector-Specific Weights (Q2 2026)**
Track agent accuracy separately by sector:
- NewsSentry: 85% for TECH, 60% for HEALTHCARE ‚Üí Sector-dependent weights

### **Phase 6: Confidence-Weighted Voting (Q3 2026)**
Agents provide confidence scores (0.0-1.0) instead of binary votes:
- Forecaster: 0.85 (high confidence approve)
- RiskOfficer: 0.40 (low confidence veto)
- Weighted consensus = weighted average of confidence scores
