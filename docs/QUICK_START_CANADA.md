   ```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables (1 min)

## 🔍 What You're Trading

### Intelligent Adjustment System

**Base Strategy:**
- **Tier 1**: Exit 30% at +5% profit (end of day)
- **Tier 2**: Exit 40% at +8-10% profit (intraday spikes)

**Intelligent Adjustments** (based on market conditions):

1. **VIX-Based** (Yahoo Finance):
   - LOW VIX (< 15): Raise targets +0.3% (greed mode)
   - HIGH VIX (> 30): Lower targets -0.8% (fear mode)

2. **Time Decay**:
   - Early day: Higher targets
   - Near close: Lower targets (up to -1.0%)

3. **Market Regime**:
   - BULL: Lower targets -0.3% (stocks run higher)
   - BEAR: Raise targets +0.8% (take profits faster)

4. **Symbol Learning**:
   - Tracks win rate per symbol
   - Adjusts targets based on historical performance
   - Min 3 exits before adjustments kick in

**Example:**
```
Base target: 5.0%
+ Volatility: -0.8% (HIGH VIX)
+ Time: +0.5% (midday)
+ Regime: +1.0% (BEAR market)
= Adjusted: 5.7% target
```

- **Avg PnL**: Should improve vs base 5% target

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused"

**Problem:** Can't connect to IBKR

**Fix:**
1. Verify TWS/Gateway is running and logged in
2. Check port: `$env:IBKR_PORT` matches TWS/Gateway
3. Verify API enabled in Global Configuration
4. Restart TWS/Gateway

### "Market data not available"

**Problem:** Can't get quotes

**Fix:**
1. Paper accounts have free delayed data (15min)
2. Subscribe to market data in account settings
3. Canadian stocks (TSX) need separate subscription

### "VIX data failed"

**Problem:** Yahoo Finance VIX provider error

**Fix:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify yfinance installed: `pip install yfinance`
3. Test manually: `python -c "import yfinance; print(yfinance.Ticker('^VIX').history(period='1d'))"`
4. System falls back to mock VIX (20.0) if Yahoo fails

### "No positions found"

**Problem:** Bot runs but doesn't find positions

**Fix:**
1. Open positions manually in TWS first (test)
2. Check bot is using correct account
3. Verify `USE_PAPER=1` matches TWS account type
4. Review logs: `logs\paper_adjustments.log`
