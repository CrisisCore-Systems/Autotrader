# README Accuracy Audit Report

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Auditor:** GitHub Copilot Coding Agent  
**Scope:** Comprehensive audit of README.md, FEATURE_CATALOG.md, and all documentation claims against actual implementation

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive audit of the README.md file was conducted to verify accuracy against the actual repository state. Multiple inaccuracies were identified and corrected, including outdated dates, incorrect file counts, broken documentation links, and duplicate content.

## Issues Identified and Corrected

### 1. Date Discrepancies ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** README stated "Current Status (October 20, 2025)" but the audit date was October 24, 2025.

**Corrections Made:**
- Line 25: Updated "October 20, 2025" → "October 24, 2025"
- Line 78: Updated "Recent Updates (October 20, 2025)" → "Recent Updates (October 2025)"
- Line 222: Updated example date "2025-10-20" → "2025-10-24"

### 2. Inflated Test Count Claims ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** README claimed "311 files changed, 50+ test classes" which was misleading.

**Methodology:** Used `find` command to count all .py files (verified October 24, 2025):
- `find tests -name "*.py" -type f | wc -l` = 86 test files
- `find src -name "*.py" -type f | wc -l` = 188 source files

**Actual State (as of Oct 24, 2025):**
- Test files: 86 Python test files (all .py files in tests/ directory)
- Source files: 188 Python source files in src/ (all .py files in src/ directory)

**Corrections Made:**
- Line 31: Changed "311 files changed, 50+ test classes" → "86 test files, 188 source files"
- Line 82: Changed "311 files with extensive test coverage" → "86 test files covering all major components"
- Line 618: Removed specific test count claim "21 tests should pass"
- Line 653: Changed "All 21 tests passing" → "86 test files covering all major components"

### 3. Broken Documentation File References ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Multiple documentation files referenced in README do not exist.

**Missing Files Removed from README:**
- `PROVENANCE_GLOSSARY_GUIDE.md`
- `OBSERVABILITY_QUICK_REF.md`
- `FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md`
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- `CLI_REFERENCE.md`
- `PROVENANCE_QUICK_REF.md`
- `SIMPLIFICATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `PROVENANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Replacement Documentation (Actual Files):**
- `docs/observability.md` - Observability guide (exists)
- `docs/CLI_BACKTEST_GUIDE.md` - CLI backtest guide (exists)
- `examples/demo_provenance.py` - Provenance demo script (exists)
- `scripts/manual/test_provenance_glossary.py` - Test script (exists)

### 4. Incorrect File Paths ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Scripts referenced in wrong locations.

**Corrections Made:**
- Line 459: `python demo_provenance.py` → `python examples/demo_provenance.py`
- Line 462: `python test_provenance_glossary.py` → `python scripts/manual/test_provenance_glossary.py`

### 5. Duplicate Content ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Repository structure section listed `prompts/` directory twice.

**Correction:** Removed duplicate prompts section (lines 527-531).

### 6. Incorrect CI/CD Reference ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** README referenced `ci/github-actions.yml` which doesn't exist.

**Actual State:** GitHub Actions workflows are in `.github/workflows/` directory with multiple workflow files:
- `ci.yml`
- `security-scan.yml`
- `tests-and-coverage.yml`
- `docs.yml`
- And 5 more workflow files

**Correction:** Line 347: `ci/github-actions.yml` → `.github/workflows/`

### 7. Inaccurate Repository Structure ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Test files section listed non-existent files.

**Missing Test Files Removed:**
- `test_all_features.py` (doesn't exist)
- `test_news_sentiment_enhanced.py` (doesn't exist)

**Actual Test Files Added:**
- `test_features.py` (exists)
- `test_broker.py` (exists)
- `test_bouncehunter_engine.py` (exists)

### 8. Ambiguous Configuration Instructions ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** Broker credentials configuration implied file exists.

**Correction:** Added clarification to "Create configs/broker_credentials.yaml" instead of implying it exists.

## Verified as Accurate

The following claims in the README were verified against the actual repository state:

### ✅ Major Features and Components
- **Broker Integration:** Confirmed multi-broker support (Paper, Alpaca, Questrade, IBKR)
  - Files verified: `src/bouncehunter/broker.py`, `src/bouncehunter/alpaca_broker.py`, `src/bouncehunter/ib_broker.py`
- **Test Suite:** 86 test files exist covering major components (see methodology above)
  - Sample files verified: `test_broker.py`, `test_bouncehunter_engine.py`, `test_agentic.py` all exist
- **Source Files:** 188 Python source files in src/ (see methodology above)
  - All major modules verified: core, api, bouncehunter, alerts, services, etc.
- **Documentation:** 160 total markdown files (146 in docs/ + 14 root-level, claim of "25+ guides" is understated)

### ✅ Repository Structure
- All major directories exist: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `configs/`, `artifacts/`, `backtest/`, `infra/`, `dashboard/`
- Source structure accurate: `src/core/`, `src/api/`, `src/bouncehunter/`, etc. all verified
- Configuration files: `llm.yaml`, `alert_rules.yaml`, `example.yaml` all confirmed

### ✅ Key Scripts and Tools
- Database initialization: `scripts/db/init_dev_databases.py` exists
- Daily automation scripts: `scripts/daily_pennyhunter.py` exists
- Analysis scripts: `scripts/analyze_pennyhunter_results.py` exists
- Runner scripts in root: `run_pennyhunter_paper.py`, `run_pennyhunter_nightly.py` exist

### ✅ GitHub Workflows
- All referenced workflow badges valid: `ci.yml`, `security-scan.yml` exist
- Complete workflow infrastructure in `.github/workflows/`

## Items That Could Not Be Verified

The following claims could not be independently verified without running the system:

1. **Phase 2 Validation Progress:** "2/20 trades accumulated" - Requires accessing trade history database
2. **Test Coverage Percentage:** "80% target", "75% enforcement" - Requires running coverage tools
3. **Win Rate:** "100.0% (Target: 65-75%)" - Requires accessing trade results

These claims appear plausible based on the codebase but cannot be verified without execution.

## Recommendations

### Completed ✅
1. All dates updated to current
2. All broken documentation links removed or replaced
3. All file paths corrected
4. Test counts updated to accurate numbers
5. Duplicate content removed
6. Repository structure section updated

### Future Maintenance Recommendations
1. **Regular Audits:** Conduct quarterly README accuracy audits
2. **Automated Checks:** Consider CI checks to validate documentation links
3. **Test Count Updates:** Use automated tools to keep test counts current
4. **Date Management:** Consider using dynamic dates or removing specific dates
5. **Phase 2 Status:** Update validation progress as trades accumulate
