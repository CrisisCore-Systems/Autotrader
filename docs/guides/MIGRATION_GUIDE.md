# 🔄 Migrating from Docker to Lightweight Development

## You're Not Alone

If you're reading this, your laptop is probably struggling with Docker. The full stack (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, MLflow, Grafana, Prometheus, Minio, Prefect) uses **4-8 GB of RAM** and causes:

- 🐌 Slow performance
- 🔥 Fan spinning constantly
- 💻 Can't run other applications
- 😤 Frustration and wanting to abandon the project

**Good news:** You can keep developing without any of this!

## Migration Path (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Save Your Work (2 minutes)

```bash
# Commit any changes
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: Before migrating to lightweight"
git push

# Export any important data from Docker (if needed)
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U autotrader autotrader > backup.sql
```

### Step 2: Stop Docker (1 minute)

```bash
# Stop all containers
docker compose down

# Optional: Free up disk space
docker system prune -a
# This can reclaim 5-10 GB!
```

### Step 3: Set Up Lightweight Mode (5 minutes)

**Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Windows:
quick_start_lightweight.bat

# Mac/Linux:
./quick_start_lightweight.sh
```

**Option B: Manual Setup**
```bash
# Copy lightweight configuration
cp .env.lightweight .env

# Install dependencies (if not already)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize databases
python scripts/db/init_dev_databases.py

# Test it works
python run_scanner_free.py
```

### Step 4: Verify Everything Works (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run smoke tests
pytest tests/test_smoke.py -v

# Try the scanner
python run_scanner_free.py

# Start API server
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Step 5: Start Developing! (2 minutes)

Open your favorite IDE and start coding. Your laptop will thank you! 🎉

## What Changed?

### Before (Docker)
```
Running services:
├── postgres      (200 MB RAM)
├── redis         (50 MB RAM)
├── kafka         (500 MB RAM)
├── zookeeper     (300 MB RAM)
├── mlflow        (300 MB RAM)
├── minio         (200 MB RAM)
├── prometheus    (400 MB RAM)
├── grafana       (300 MB RAM)
└── prefect       (400 MB RAM)
Total: ~2.5 GB + overhead = 4-8 GB actual usage
```

### After (Lightweight)
```
Running services:
└── Your Python process (200-500 MB RAM)
Total: 200-500 MB

What happened to the others?
├── postgres      → SQLite (built-in, no server)
├── redis         → In-memory dict (no server)
├── kafka         → Direct function calls (no messaging)
├── mlflow        → File-based tracking (no server)
├── minio         → Local files (no object storage)
├── prometheus    → Log-based metrics (no server)
├── grafana       → CLI reports (no dashboards)
└── prefect       → Manual scripts (no orchestration)
```

## Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: "I need my data from Docker Postgres"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Export from Docker
docker compose up -d postgres
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U autotrader autotrader > backup.sql

# Import to SQLite (if needed)
# Most development doesn't need old data - start fresh!
python scripts/db/init_dev_databases.py
```

### Issue 2: "Docker commands in scripts fail"

**What to do:**
- Replace `docker compose exec` commands with direct Python execution
- Scripts like `run_scanner_free.py` already work without Docker

**Example migration:**
```bash
# Old (Docker):
docker compose exec app python run_scanner_free.py

# New (Lightweight):
python run_scanner_free.py
```

### Issue 3: "MLflow UI not working"

**Solution:**
Lightweight mode uses file-based MLflow. To view UI (optional):
```bash
# Install MLflow if not already
pip install mlflow

# Start UI
mlflow ui

# Visit: http://localhost:5000
```

### Issue 4: "Integration tests failing"

**Expected!** Some tests need full infrastructure. Solutions:

1. **Use CI/CD** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   git push  # GitHub Actions runs full tests
   ```

2. **Run only unit tests locally**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_smoke.py tests/test_features.py -v
   ```

3. **Use hybrid Docker** (if really needed):
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.lightweight.yml up -d
   # Runs only Postgres (~100 MB)
   ```

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Development Workflow

| Task | Docker | Lightweight | Time Saved |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **First-time setup** | 30+ min | 5 min | 25 min |
| **Daily startup** | 5 min | 5 sec | 4 min 55 sec |
| **Run tests** | 2 min | 20 sec | 1 min 40 sec |
| **Start API** | 1 min | 5 sec | 55 sec |
| **Edit + reload** | 10 sec | 1 sec | 9 sec |

### Resource Usage

| Metric | Docker | Lightweight | Reduction |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **RAM** | 4-8 GB | 200-500 MB | **90%** |
| **Disk I/O** | Heavy | Minimal | **95%** |
| **CPU** | High | Low | **80%** |
| **Startup** | 5 min | 5 sec | **98%** |
| **Fan noise** | 🔥🔥🔥 | 😌 | Peaceful |

## Advanced: Hybrid Mode

Need PostgreSQL but not the rest? Use hybrid:

```bash
# Start only Postgres
docker compose -f docker-compose.lightweight.yml up -d

# Update .env to use it
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://autotrader:autotrader@localhost:5432/autotrader

# Everything else remains lightweight
```

**Memory usage:** ~300 MB total (Postgres + Python)

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use Lightweight When:
- ✅ Daily development
- ✅ Writing code
- ✅ Running tests
- ✅ Learning the codebase
- ✅ Quick experiments
- ✅ Your laptop has limited resources

### Use Docker When:
- ⚠️ Testing production-like environment
- ⚠️ Debugging infrastructure issues
- ⚠️ Performance benchmarking
- ⚠️ You have a powerful machine

### Use CI/CD When:
- ✅ Integration testing
- ✅ Performance testing
- ✅ Before merging PRs
- ✅ Security scanning

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Commit and push current work
- [ ] Export important data from Docker (if any)
- [ ] Stop Docker containers
- [ ] Run `python setup_lightweight.py`
- [ ] Test basic functionality
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Update any custom scripts
- [ ] Update documentation (if you added any)
- [ ] Clean up Docker images (optional): `docker system prune -a`

---

## Rollback Plan

Changed your mind? Easy to go back:

```bash
# Copy Docker config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your settings
nano .env

# Start Docker
docker compose up -d

# Done!
```

Your lightweight setup remains - you can switch back anytime.

```
🔥 Fan: LOUD
💻 RAM: 7.2 GB / 8 GB used
⚡ CPU: 80-100%
🐌 Response: Sluggish
😤 You: Frustrated
📊 Other apps: Can't run
```

```
😌 Fan: Quiet
💻 RAM: 1.8 GB / 8 GB used
⚡ CPU: 10-20%
⚡ Response: Snappy
😊 You: Happy coding!
📊 Other apps: Plenty of room
```

**This is why we created lightweight mode.** Enjoy developing again! 🎉
