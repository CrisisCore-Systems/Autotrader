# Advanced Risk Filters Implementation - Complete

## üéØ Objective: Tactical Enhancements for Quality & Risk Control

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: 5 Advanced Filter Modules

---

## 1. Dynamic Liquidity Delta Filter

**Purpose:** Detect evaporating liquidity before it causes problems

**Implementation:**
```python
check_liquidity_delta(ticker, hist, threshold_pct=-30.0)
```

**How it works:**
- Compares 14-day average volume vs 7-day average volume
- Flags tickers with declining liquidity (> 30% drop)
- Prevents trading stocks losing market interest

**Example Result:**
```
‚ùå CLOV: Liquidity declining -32.3%
‚úÖ INTR: Liquidity stable +5.2%
```

---

## 2. Effective Slippage Estimation

**Purpose:** Prevent surprise execution costs on illiquid stocks

**Implementation:**
```python
estimate_slippage(ticker, position_size_dollars, hist)
```

**Formula:**
```
slippage ‚âà (position_size / daily_volume) * (spread / 2)
```

**How it works:**
- Calculates position size as % of daily dollar volume
- Estimates spread from High-Low daily range
- Warns if slippage > 5% (configurable)

**Example Result:**
```
‚úÖ INTR: Position 0.5% of volume, spread 2.6% ‚Üí Slippage 0.6%
‚ùå ILLIQUID: Position 15% of volume, spread 8% ‚Üí Slippage 6.0%
```

---

## 3. Cash Runway Filter

**Purpose:** Filter out high-risk money-burners (companies running out of cash)

**Implementation:**
```python
check_cash_runway(ticker, min_months=6.0)
```

**Formula:**
```
runway_months = (cash + equivalents) / quarterly_burn * 3
```

**How it works:**
- Pulls balance sheet data (cash & equivalents)
- Pulls cash flow statement (operating cash flow)
- Calculates months until company runs out of money
- Rejects if < 6 months runway

**Example Result:**
```
‚úÖ CLOV: Cash flow positive: $34.8M/quarter
‚ùå BURNCO: Only 3.2 months runway (need 6)
‚úÖ INTR: 18.5 months runway
```

---

## 4. Sector Diversification Control

**Purpose:** Avoid sector concentration risk

**Implementation:**
```python
check_sector_diversification(ticker, sector, max_per_sector=3)
track_sector(ticker, sector)
```

**How it works:**
- Tracks which sectors current positions belong to
- Limits maximum positions per sector (default: 3)
- Prevents over-concentration in single sector
- Auto-resets between runs

**Example Result:**
```
‚úÖ INTR (Technology): First in sector (0/3)
‚úÖ CLOV (Healthcare): Sector OK (1/3)
‚ùå TECH4 (Technology): Sector full (3/3)
```

---

## 5. Volume Fade Detection

**Purpose:** Identify weak breakouts losing momentum

**Implementation:**
```python
detect_volume_fade(ticker, hist, lookback_days=5)
```

**How it works:**
- Compares latest volume vs 5-day average
- Flags if latest < 50% of recent average
- Indicates loss of interest / failed breakout

**Example Result:**
```
‚úÖ INTR: Volume stable +12.3%
‚ùå FADER: Volume fading -62.5%
```

---

## Integration: Quality Gate System

**Comprehensive Check:**
```python
results = advanced_filters.run_quality_gate(
    ticker, 
    hist, 
    position_size_dollars=100,
    config={
        'liquidity_delta_threshold': -30.0,
        'max_slippage_pct': 5.0,
        'min_cash_runway_months': 6.0,
        'max_per_sector': 3,
        'check_volume_fade': True
    }
)
```

**Returns:**
```python
{
    'ticker': 'INTR',
    'passed': True,
    'checks': {
        'liquidity_delta': {'passed': True, 'delta_pct': +5.2, ...},
        'slippage': {'passed': True, 'slippage_pct': 0.6, ...},
        'cash_runway': {'passed': True, 'runway_months': 18.5, ...},
        'sector': {'passed': True, 'sector_name': 'Technology', ...},
        'volume_fade': {'detected': False, 'fade_pct': +12.3, ...}
    }
}
```

## Configuration (pennyhunter.yaml)

```yaml
advanced_filters:
  enabled: true
  
  liquidity_health:
    enabled: true
    delta_threshold_pct: -30.0
    
  slippage_control:
    enabled: true
    max_slippage_pct: 5.0
    
  financial_health:
    enabled: true
    min_cash_runway_months: 6.0
    
  diversification:
    enabled: true
    max_per_sector: 3
    
  breakout_quality:
    enabled: true
    check_volume_fade: true
```

## Test Results

**Test Case: CLOV vs INTR**

### CLOV (FAILED Quality Gate):
```
‚ùå LIQUIDITY_DELTA: Liquidity declining -32.3%
‚úÖ SLIPPAGE: Position 0.0% of volume, spread 5.6%
‚úÖ CASH_RUNWAY: Cash flow positive: $34.8M/quarter
‚úÖ SECTOR: First in sector
‚úÖ VOLUME_FADE: Volume stable -22.9%

Overall: ‚ùå FAILED (liquidity declining)
```

### INTR (PASSED Quality Gate):
```
‚úÖ LIQUIDITY_DELTA: Liquidity stable +5.2%
‚úÖ SLIPPAGE: Position 0.5% of volume, spread 2.6%
‚úÖ CASH_RUNWAY: 18.5 months runway
‚úÖ SECTOR: Technology (0/3)
‚úÖ VOLUME_FADE: Volume stable +12.3%

Overall: ‚úÖ PASSED
```

**Result:** System correctly rejected CLOV (declining liquidity) and accepted INTR (all checks passed)

## Paper Trading Integration

**Workflow:**
1. Scanner finds signals with Phase 1 scoring
2. **NEW:** Run advanced quality gate before execution
3. If passed: Track sector, execute trade
4. If failed: Log rejection reason, skip trade

**Code Added to run_pennyhunter_paper.py:**
```python
# Run advanced quality gate if enabled
if self.advanced_filters_enabled and 'hist' in signal:
    quality_results = self.advanced_filters.run_quality_gate(
        ticker, signal['hist'], position_size_dollars
    )
    
    if not quality_results['passed']:
        logger.warning(f"‚ùå {ticker} FAILED quality gate")
        return False
    
    # Track sector for diversification
    sector = quality_results['checks']['sector']['sector_name']
    self.advanced_filters.track_sector(ticker, sector)
```

## Future Enhancements (Not Yet Implemented)

From the original suggestion list:

### 6. Catalyst / News Filter
**Purpose:** Align signals with real drivers
**Implementation Idea:**
- Parse news API (e.g., Benzinga, Alpha Vantage)
- Only consider gaps with news catalyst
- Filter out "phantom" gaps

### 7. Adaptive Score Weighting
**Purpose:** Change feature weights by market regime
**Implementation Idea:**
```python
if vix > 30:  # High volatility
    weight_momentum_higher()
elif vix < 20:  # Low volatility
    weight_fundamentals_higher()
```

### 8. Flag Reversal Potential
**Purpose:** Identify weak breakouts
**Implementation Idea:**
- Volume fade (‚úÖ implemented!)
- Lack of follow-through (check next day action)
- Failed higher highs

### 9. Backtest Hazard Module
**Purpose:** Simulate "near misses"
**Implementation Idea:**
- Backtest signals we skipped vs signals we took
- Identify if filters are too strict/lenient
- Continuous improvement loop

### 10. "Drift Out / Drop Zones" Monitor
**Purpose:** Fall-out safety for existing positions
**Implementation Idea:**
- Monitor open positions for deteriorating conditions
- Auto-exit if liquidity dries up
- Auto-exit if cash runway drops below threshold
