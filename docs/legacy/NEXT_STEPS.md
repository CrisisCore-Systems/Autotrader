## 📋 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### Phase 2 Validation - Top Priority 🎯

**Objective**: Accumulate 20+ paper trades to validate 65-75% win rate

**Daily Workflow**:
```powershell
# 1. Run daily paper trading
cd C:\Users\kay\Documents\Projects\AutoTrader\Autotrader
.venv-1\Scripts\activate
python scripts\daily_pennyhunter.py

# 2. Analyze results
python scripts\analyze_pennyhunter_results.py

# 3. Review and adjust if needed
python scripts\analyze_pennyhunter_results.py --export-csv
```

**Current Status**:
- ✅ 2/20 trades completed (10%)
- ✅ 100% win rate (preliminary - need more data)
- 🎯 Target: 65-75% win rate after 20 trades
- ⏰ Timeline: 2-3 weeks of daily trading

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Accumulate 20+ completed trades
- [ ] Achieve ≥ 65% win rate (Phase 2 target)
- [ ] Profit factor ≥ 1.5
- [ ] Max drawdown < 15%

**See [`PHASE2_VALIDATION_PLAN.md`](PHASE2_VALIDATION_PLAN.md) for detailed plan**

## 🔧 Additional Improvements (Optional)

### Git Workflow Enhancements
```powershell
# Create .gitignore entries for sensitive data
echo "configs/broker_credentials.yaml" >> .gitignore
echo "*.db" >> .gitignore
echo "reports/*.json" >> .gitignore

# Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Test Coverage Expansion
```bash
# Run test suite with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing -v

# Focus on high-value modules
pytest tests/test_broker.py --cov=src.bouncehunter.broker --cov-report=term
pytest tests/test_bouncehunter_engine.py --cov=src.bouncehunter.engine --cov-report=term
```

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Create operator runbook for daily operations
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common broker issues
- [ ] Document Phase 2.5 memory system design
- [ ] Update ROADMAP.md with Phase 3 agentic plans

## 📊 Validation Checklist

### Phase 2 Validation Progress

**Weekly Review** (Every 5 trades):
- [ ] Review win rate trend
- [ ] Analyze losing trades for patterns
- [ ] Verify quality gates are working
- [ ] Check for sector concentration
- [ ] Monitor market regime impact

**After 20 Trades** (Milestone Decision Point):
- [ ] Calculate final Phase 2 win rate
- [ ] Generate statistical significance report
- [ ] Identify top-performing tickers
- [ ] Analyze filter effectiveness
- [ ] Document lessons learned

**Decision Criteria**:
- ✅ **Win rate ≥ 65%**: Proceed to Phase 2.5 (lightweight memory)
- ⚠️ **Win rate 55-65%**: Review quality gates, collect 10 more trades
- ❌ **Win rate < 55%**: Debug systematic issues, pause Phase 2.5
