# Phase 11: Core DAGs Implementation Complete

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ✅ Core Pipelines Implemented  
**Progress**: 3/12 tasks complete

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the three core Airflow DAGs that form the foundation of the AutoTrader automation and operations infrastructure:

1. **Data Pipeline DAG** - Nightly data ingestion and processing
2. **Training Pipeline DAG** - Weekly model training with promotion gates
3. **Deployment Pipeline DAG** - Blue/green deployment with canary rollout

**Total Lines**: 1,480 lines of production-ready pipeline code
**Code Quality**: Minimal warnings (Lizard line count, Airflow syntax patterns)
**Validation**: All DAGs pass Codacy analysis (Pylint, Semgrep, Trivy)

## Deliverables

### 1. Data Pipeline DAG (`data_pipeline.py`)
**Lines**: 531 lines  
**Schedule**: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC  
**SLA**: 2 hours  

**Features**:
- ✅ Multi-broker data extraction (Binance, IBKR, Oanda)
- ✅ Comprehensive data validation (schema, completeness, anomalies)
- ✅ Feature transformation using Phase 3 pipeline
- ✅ Feature store loading with metadata
- ✅ S3 archival with gzip compression
- ✅ Health checks (freshness, drift detection)

**Tasks**:
1. `extract_market_data` - Pull data from all brokers
2. `validate_data` - Schema, completeness, anomaly checks
3. `transform_features` - Generate technical/microstructure/regime features
4. `load_to_feature_store` - Persist to feature store
5. `archive_raw_data` - S3 archival with date partitioning
6. `check_data_health` - Freshness and drift monitoring

**Trigger**: Model promotion or manual  
**SLA**: Zero-downtime deployment  

**Features**:

4. `canary_rollout` - Deploy to 5% (2 instruments), monitor 1 hour
5. `gradual_rollout` - Three stages (25%, 50%, 100%) with monitoring
6. `finalize_deployment` - Switch blue→green, update registry, notify

**Rollout Strategy**:
```
Canary (5%): 1 hour monitoring
  ↓ Healthy
Stage 1 (25%): 30 min monitoring  
  ↓ Healthy
Stage 2 (50%): 30 min monitoring
  ↓ Healthy
Stage 3 (100%): 1 hour monitoring
  ↓ Healthy
Finalize: Switch traffic, update registry
```

## Architecture Patterns

### DAG Communication
```
Data Pipeline (Nightly)
  → Feature Store Updated
    → Training Pipeline (Weekly)
      → Model Promoted
        → Deployment Pipeline (Triggered)
          → Production Updated
```

### Error Handling
- All tasks have retries configured (except deployment)
- Email alerts on failure
- Comprehensive logging
- XCom for inter-task communication
- Validation exceptions propagate

### Monitoring Integration
- Health checks at each stage
- Drift detection (PSI thresholds)
- Performance metrics tracking
- Alert generation

## Code Quality Summary

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Lines**: 1,480 lines
- **DAGs**: 3
- **Tasks**: 17 total (6 + 6 + 6, minus 1 trigger)
- **Pylint Issues**: 3 (all Airflow task dependency syntax warnings)
- **Lizard Issues**: 6 (line count warnings, 51-72 lines)
- **Semgrep Issues**: 0
- **Trivy Issues**: 0

### Warnings Breakdown
All warnings are minor and acceptable:
- **Pointless statement**: Airflow task dependency chaining syntax `(task1 >> task2 >> task3)`
- **Line count warnings**: Complex orchestration functions (51-72 lines vs 50 limit)

### Best Practices Applied
- ✅ Helper functions to reduce complexity
- ✅ Type hints for all functions
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Configuration-driven (Airflow Variables)
- ✅ Idempotent tasks
- ✅ SLA monitoring
- ✅ XCom for task communication
