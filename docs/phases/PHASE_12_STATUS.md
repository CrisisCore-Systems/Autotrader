# Phase 12: Monitoring, Analytics, and Governance — Status

**Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Monitoring Stack Production Ready + Demo Complete ✅  
**Progress**: 6/6 Components Complete (100%)  
**Next Phase**: Phase 13 — Final Integration & Production

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 12 is complete. The audit trail foundation now feeds a full governance stack covering real-time dashboards, post-trade analytics, anomaly detection, automated reporting, and compliance monitoring. All deliverables share a dataclass-driven API surface, pass Codacy security/static analysis, and are instrumented for future automation in Phase 13. Remaining technical debt is limited to medium-severity Lizard complexity warnings inside analytics/anomaly helpers, earmarked for post-telemetry refactors.

## Completed Deliverables

| Component | Files | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit Trail System | `autotrader/audit/trail.py`, `autotrader/audit/__init__.py` | Unified event capture (market, signal, risk, order, fill, LLM, circuit breaker) with JSONL persistence, trade reconstruction, pandas export, compliance reporting. |
| Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards | `autotrader/monitoring/realtime/dashboard.py`, `autotrader/monitoring/realtime/__init__.py` | Thread-safe aggregator, latency analytics, Sharpe/drawdown, per-instrument metrics, risk limit consumption snapshots for Grafana/Prometheus. |
| Post-Trade Analytics Engine | `autotrader/analytics/pnl_attribution.py`, `autotrader/analytics/slippage.py`, `autotrader/analytics/regime.py`, package init | Factor/instrument/time/regime PnL attribution, slippage decomposition, regime classification with performance metrics and full attribution reports. |
| Anomaly Detection System | `autotrader/monitoring/anomaly/detector.py`, package init | Z-score/IQR detectors, Isolation Forest & One-Class SVM pipelines, rule checks, `Anomaly` dataclass with severity/context, bulk `detect_all`. |
| Weekly Research Report Generator | `autotrader/reports/weekly.py`, package init | Generates Markdown weekly reports incl. executive summary, highlights, tables, notable trades, leveraging analytics outputs. |
| Compliance Monitoring Framework | `autotrader/monitoring/compliance/monitor.py`, package init, `scripts/demo_compliance_monitoring.py` (320 LOC) | Policy-driven checks across risk events, LLM decisions, order notional limits, anomaly tie-ins; emits `ComplianceReport` with severity counts and metadata. **Includes 6-demo comprehensive usage script** ✅

## Quality & Tooling Snapshot

Codacy CLI (Trivy, Pylint, Semgrep, Lizard) executed on October 25, 2025:

- **Clean**: `monitoring/realtime/dashboard.py`, `reports/weekly.py`, `monitoring/compliance/monitor.py`, `scripts/demo_compliance_monitoring.py`.
- **Known Complexity Warnings**:
  - `analytics/pnl_attribution.py`: `attribute_by_factor` (CCN 19), `attribute_by_instrument` (CCN 17), `attribute_by_horizon` (CCN 12), `attribute_by_regime` (CCN 9), `generate_full_attribution_report` (CCN 12).
  - `analytics/slippage.py`: `generate_slippage_report` (82 LOC > 50 LOC target).
  - `analytics/regime.py`: `analyze_performance_by_regime` (CCN 10, 51 LOC).
  - `monitoring/anomaly/detector.py`: `_infer_anomaly_type` (CCN 11), `detect_isolation_forest` (CCN 10, 62 LOC), `detect_one_class_svm` (CCN 10, 58 LOC).

No security vulnerabilities or lint issues were reported. Complexity warnings are tracked for follow-up refactors in maintenance windows.

## Impact

- **Operational Visibility**: Execution teams gain minute-level dashboards with risk limit consumption, latency percentiles, and slippage telemetry.
- **Research Enablement**: Quant teams can attribute PnL by factor/regime and receive weekly Markdown reports without manual spreadsheet work.
- **Governance & Compliance**: Automated audits catch missing risk checks, forbidden LLM overrides, and notional breaches; anomaly insights feed compliance metadata.
- **Scalability**: Dataclass APIs and `.to_dict()` serialisation make Phase 13 integrations (Prometheus exporters, Slack bots, PagerDuty hooks) straightforward.

## Dependencies & Integration Notes

1. **Audit Trail Availability**: All modules depend on `AuditTrailStore`. Use dependency injection or `get_audit_trail()` factory; ensure storage tier mounted in production.
2. **Analytics Inputs**: Post-trade analytics expect reconstructed trades (`Trade` dataclass) and fill histories; weekly reports call into these helpers automatically.
3. **Anomaly Metrics**: `ComplianceMonitor.analyze_period()` can ingest dashboard metrics dictionary for anomaly enrichment; provide `metrics` param from realtime aggregator when available.
4. **Configuration**: Policies and limits are dataclasses (`CompliancePolicy`, `RiskLimitConfig`, `WeeklyReportConfig`) for YAML/JSON serialisation. Persist chosen defaults in Phase 13 infrastructure repo.

## Next Actions (Phase 13 Preview)

- Connect realtime snapshots to Grafana dashboards and Prometheus exporters in production clusters.
- Configure alert routing (PagerDuty, Slack, email) based on `ComplianceIssue` severity and anomaly types.
- Prioritise complexity refactors after observing live telemetry to avoid premature optimisation.
- Add integration tests covering the full pipeline (audit trail → analytics → reporting/compliance) as part of deployment gating.

Phase 12 deliverables are fully landed; the programme is ready to advance to Phase 13 for final integration and production hardening.
