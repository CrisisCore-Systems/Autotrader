---

## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue 8: Provenance Depth Enhancement
**Problem:** Artifact templates lacked standardized lineage chain (source commit, feature hash, model route).

**Solution:** Enhanced `provenance.py` with `LineageMetadata` class and automatic git commit capture.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic git commit tracking
- Feature code hashing
- Model version tracking
- Environment capture (Python version, packages)
- Pipeline versioning
- Data snapshot hashing

**Files:** `src/core/provenance.py` (modified)

---

### ✅ Issue 9: Alert Metric Normalization
**Problem:** Mixed thresholds (percent vs raw) with no annotation; unclear units.

**Solution:** Created comprehensive `alert_thresholds.yaml` with explicit units and annotations.

**Key Features:**
- Explicit unit definitions (percentage, ratio, percentage_points, etc.)
- Clear annotations for each threshold
- Validation rules
- Migration guide
- Documentation and examples

**Files:** `config/alert_thresholds.yaml` (new)

---

### ✅ Issue 10: Semgrep Rule Breadth
**Problem:** Only 2 custom rules; missing critical security patterns.

**Solution:** Expanded Semgrep rules from 2 to 45+ comprehensive patterns.

**Coverage Added:**
- Subprocess injection (3 rules)
- Insecure deserialization (3 rules)
- Request timeouts (3 rules)
- Exception handling (3 rules)
- File operations (3 rules)
- Cryptography (2 rules)
- Database security (2 rules)
- Session security (3 rules)
- And 20+ more patterns

**Files:** `ci/semgrep.yml` (modified)

---

### ✅ Issue 11: Coverage & Quality Gates
**Problem:** CI accepts lint/type errors (continue-on-error: true) and no coverage threshold.

**Solution:** Enforced strict quality gates in CI pipeline.

**Key Changes:**
- Coverage threshold: 80% minimum (fails if below)
- Removed all `continue-on-error` flags
- Added strict linting (ruff, mypy --strict, pylint ≥8.0)
- Quality gate job that fails pipeline on violations

**Files:** `.github/workflows/tests-and-coverage.yml` (modified)

---

### ✅ Issue 12: Reproducibility Boundaries
**Problem:** No "snapshot mode" flag; lack of enforced immutability.

**Solution:** Comprehensive snapshot mode system with cryptographic verification.

**Key Features:**
- Three execution modes (DYNAMIC, SNAPSHOT, RECORD)
- SHA-256 cryptographic verification
- Enforced immutability in SNAPSHOT mode
- Snapshot registry and management
- Integrity verification
- Manifest export

**Files:** `src/core/snapshot_mode.py` (new)

---

### ✅ Issue 13: Notebook Execution in CI
**Problem:** Notebooks validated for format only, not executed with deterministic seed.

**Solution:** Complete notebook validation CI workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Execution with 10-minute timeout
- Deterministic seed enforcement (PYTHONHASHSEED=42)
- Error detection in outputs
- Drift marker detection
- Size limits
- Code quality checks (ruff, black, isort)
- Weekly scheduled runs
- Artifact upload

**Files:** `.github/workflows/notebook-validation.yml` (new)

---

### ✅ Issue 14: Output Schema Evolution
**Problem:** Artifacts not versioned against published schema registry.

**Solution:** Complete schema registry system with validation.

**Key Features:**
- Versioned schema definitions
- Field-level validation (type, required, constraints)
- Backward compatibility tracking
- Breaking change documentation
- Migration guides
- Example data
- Documentation export

**Files:** 
- `src/core/schema_registry.py` (new)
- `schemas/gem_score_result_v1_0_0.json` (new)
- `schemas/market_snapshot_v1_0_0.json` (new)
- `schemas/notebook_scan_output_v1_0_0.json` (new)

## Usage Examples

### 1. Enhanced Provenance
```python
from src.core.provenance import capture_lineage_metadata

lineage = capture_lineage_metadata(
    feature_hash="sha256:abc",
    model_route="groq:llama3.1"
)
artifact_id = tracker.register_artifact(..., lineage_metadata=lineage)
```

### 2. Snapshot Mode
```python
from src.core.snapshot_mode import enable_snapshot_mode

enable_snapshot_mode()
data = fetch_data()  # Uses snapshot, not live fetch
```

### 3. Schema Validation
```python
from src.core.schema_registry import get_schema_registry

registry = get_schema_registry()
is_valid, errors = registry.validate_data("gem_score_result", data)
```

### 4. Alert Thresholds
```python
import yaml
with open("config/alert_thresholds.yaml") as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)
threshold = config["gem_score_thresholds"]["high_potential"]
```

---

## Migration Path

### For Existing Code

1. **Update provenance calls:**
   ```python
   # Add lineage metadata parameter
   lineage = capture_lineage_metadata()
   artifact_id = tracker.register_artifact(..., lineage_metadata=lineage)
   ```

2. **Load standardized thresholds:**
   ```python
   # Replace hardcoded values
   threshold = config["thresholds"]["metric_name"]
   ```

3. **Add schema validation:**
   ```python
   # Before returning outputs
   is_valid, errors = registry.validate_data(schema_id, output)
   ```

4. **Enable snapshot mode for tests:**
   ```python
   # In test setup
   from src.core.snapshot_mode import enable_snapshot_mode
   enable_snapshot_mode()
   ```
