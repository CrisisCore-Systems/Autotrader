# VoidBloom Greatness Roadmap

## Vision Statement
Transform VoidBloom into the definitive institutional-grade decision platform for crypto markets: a system that surfaces alpha faster than human analysts, mitigates tail-risk in real time, and automates execution with quant-grade discipline.

## Strategic Pillars
1. **Total Signal Dominance** – Aggregate and normalise every meaningful on-chain, off-chain, and social signal with sub-minute latency.
2. **Predictive Edge** – Deploy adaptive models that convert multi-modal signals into probabilistic trade ideas and actionable risk controls.
3. **Trust & Explainability** – Ensure every recommendation is auditable, interpretable, and aligned with regulatory best practices.
4. **Autonomous Operations** – Orchestrate the full lifecycle from detection to execution, with human-in-the-loop guardrails.

## Horizon Plan
### Immediate (Weeks)
- **Signal Coverage Audit**: map current feeds vs. desired universe (CoinDesk, on-chain metrics, order flow, derivatives). Identify blind spots and prioritise.
- **Latency + Reliability Hardening**: instrument ingestion SLAs, add circuit breakers & graceful degradation paths, expand caching policies.
- **Unified Feature Store**: centralise engineered features (sentiment scores, pattern flags, liquidity metrics) for reuse across models and services.
- **Dashboard Lift**: surface confidence intervals, anomaly alerts, and cross-token correlations directly in the sentiment UI.

### Near Term (1-3 Months)
- **Multi-Layer Model Stack**: combine technical pattern detectors, LLM-driven narratives, and gradient-boosted classifiers into ensemble signals.
- **Pump-and-Dump Sentinel v1**: fuse sentiment anomalies with on-chain whale flows and DEX liquidity depletion alarms.
- **Risk Command Center**: build live VaR/expected shortfall dashboards with stress-test presets and kill-switch automation.
- **Execution Simulator**: integrate a backtest + paper-trading harness that replays signals against historical order books.

### Mid Term (3-6 Months)
- **Active Learning Loop**: collect analyst feedback, executed trades, and outcomes to retrain models continuously.
- **Cross-Market Arb Radar**: ingest CEX vs. DEX spreads, funding rates, and perp basis moves; raise actionable arbitrage alerts.
- **Playbook Automation**: convert runbooks into machine-readable workflows (e.g., YAML) powering the ops bot.
- **Compliance Layer**: implement audit logging, policy checks, and data residency controls for institutional users.

### Long Term (6-12 Months)
- **Autonomous Vaults**: permissioned strategy vaults executing signals with configurable risk appetite.
- **Marketplace Ecosystem**: allow partners to publish data connectors, strategies, and bespoke dashboards via plugin API.
- **Narrative Intelligence Graph**: build knowledge graph linking addresses, entities, governance proposals, and media narratives.
- **Quant Co-Pilot**: conversational agent that can design experiments, generate code patches, and run validations on demand.

## Enablers & Investments
- **Data Infrastructure**: migrate to event-driven pipeline (Kafka + Flink or Pulsar) for millisecond signal propagation.
- **ML Ops**: adopt feature stores (Feast) and model registries (MLflow) with CI-driven validation.
- **Security**: integrate runtime secrets management, dependency audits, and threat monitoring (Trivy, OSSF Scorecards).
- **Talent & Process**: form Tiger Teams (Signals, Execution, Risk, Ops) with weekly OKRs and postmortem rituals.

## Success Metrics
- Signal coverage >95% for Tier-1 market events within 2 minutes.
- Predictive models delivering >0.65 precision on directional calls at 4h horizon.
- Automated risk responses reducing drawdowns by >30% vs. manual baseline.
- Ops automation handling >85% of routine interventions without pager duty.
- User NPS >60 with <1% uptime degradation during market stress.

## Next Steps Checklist
1. Schedule a roadmap review with engineering + quant + ops stakeholders.
2. Staff a discovery sprint for the Signal Coverage Audit.
3. Prioritise pump-and-dump sentinel MVP in the upcoming iteration.
4. Stand up metrics dashboards to begin tracking the success KPIs.
5. Publish quarterly updates against this roadmap and adjust based on learnings.
